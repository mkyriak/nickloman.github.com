  content: "Couldn't agree more with this pitch! One of the really cool feature of
    posting to arXiv not mentioned here is that Google Scholar indexes arXiv preprints
    (e.g. http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?sortby=pubdate&amp;hl=en&amp;user=j9ciKqkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works),
    which means that you can see who is citing your work before it is published &amp;
    you can improve the accuracy of the papers Scholar Update reccomends for you.
    Also, Graham and Joe are doing a great job at getting people to write background
    commentaries on their own papers, which adds a lot of value to the Haldane's Sieve
    site beyond discussion threads on the paper itself.\r\n\r\nP.S. our contribution
    to microbial genome evolution field on arXiv and Haldane's Sieve can be found

  content: Hi Casey! Thanks for stopping by. That is indeed a really cool feature
    of Google Scholar and one I didn't know about. Makes it much easier to track what's
    going on! Also sorry for not mentioning your Wolbachia paper, I saw it at the
    time and it is also very cool!

  content: "\"No, it doesn’t prevent you publishing in peer-reviewed journals\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    Nick, even using your own reference there is a considerable number of journals
    that would not let you publish with them if you have a public preprint. This seems
    to be a sweeping policy with CSHL press, ASM and Cell Press.  Also, although Wiley-Blackwell
    is listed as \"mixed/unclear\", the journals I have looked at prohibit pre-publications.
    The culture of these journals reflects the historically prevalent culture in experimental
    life science, which does not consider prepublications a worthy effort.  I guess
    what I am trying to say that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done
    to get prepublications as acceptable in life science as they are in other fields,
    as there are sentiments best described by the following statements: \"I won't
    go on arxiv because that would prohibit me from publishing later\", \"Going on
    arxiv is worthless, I could get scooped and arxiv won't count as a prior publication
    or even evidence of precedence\", \"If I go on arxiv that signals my colleagues
    that my work is not good enough to go somewhere 'real' \".  These sentiments need
    to be addressed (and not sneeringly dismissed) if any progress is to be made with
    prepublication culture in  life science."

<p>Something very exciting has happened in recent weeks on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, the preprint server which many biologists believe is the reserve of angry physicists, beardy mathematicians and unwashed computer scientists  (<em>joke</em>!!!).</p>
<p>Not any longer. I first felt a disturbance in the force in September when a few high-profile human genomicists started making pledges to send all their manuscripts to arXiv first, including the angriest man in biology, <a href="https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/245005937579024386">Michael Eisen</a>. I'm pretty sure genomics wunder-kinds Daniel MacArthur and Joe Pickrell are also planning on sending their manuscripts there first. The venerable Ewan Birney is also thinking of getting in on the action, tweeting back in August:</p>
<blockquote><p> "Ah. Bugger. Scooped by George Church on arbitrary DNA storage. Our paper is in review &lt;sigh&gt;. (wish we had posted on arXive now"</p></blockquote>
<p>Things are happening!</p>
<p>Those working in human population genetics and paleogenomics are already posting fascinating, high-impact manuscripts, see for example "<a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/09/05/the-date-of-interbreeding-between-neandertals-and-modern-humans/">The Date of Interbreeding between Neandertals and Modern Humans</a>"  from a team including  Svante Pääbo. Joe Pickrell and crew posted a detailed study on "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5552">The Genetic Prehistory of Southern Africa</a>", focusing on groups which speak using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant">click-consonants</a>.</p>
<p>But as interesting and inspiring as these papers are, I am more interested in bioinformatics, microbial genomics, evolution and ecology, so these papers don't really impact my day job. But recently things have got even more interesting .. by which I mean <em>microbial</em>. Witness:</p>
<p>Posted 15th October 2012: Species Identification and Unbiased Profiling of Complex Microbial Communities Using Shotgun Illumina Sequencing of 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequences (<a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/10/15/species-identification-and-unbiased-profiling-of-complex-microbial-communities-using-shotgun-illumina-sequencing-of-16s-rrna-amplicon-sequences/">Haldane's Sieve</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3464">arXiv</a>). This paper describes a novel method of using shotgun sequencing of long 16S amplicons  to permit species-level assignments.</p>
<p>Posted 28th September 2012: Horizontal gene transfer may explain variation in θs (<a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/10/02/horizontal-gene-transfer-may-explain-variation-in-%ce%b8s/">Haldane's Sieve</a>) - a paper from <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment">Lenski</a></strong> no less, which gives a possible explanation of the intriguing findings of potential mutational "hotspots" in the <em>E. coli</em> genome <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7396/full/nature10995.html">published in Nature</a> by Inigo Martincorena and Nicholas Luscombe. This paper suggested an "evolutionary risk management strategy" which challenges our fundamental understanding of genetic mutations being acquired randomly and subsequently selected for (demonstrated beautifully by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luria%E2%80%93Delbr%C3%BCck_experiment">Luria and Delbruck</a> in 1943). Lenski, using data from his long-term <em>E. coli</em> evolution experiment suggests that in fact undetected recombination is instead the likely cause for these mutational hotspots.</p>
<p>Posted 13 Oct 2012: A 454 survey of the community composition and core microbiome of the common bed bug, <em>Cimex lectularius</em>, reveals significant microbial community structure across an urban landscape (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3707">http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3707</a>). Notable for being one of the first microbial ecology studies published in arXiv and obviously bed-bugs are kind of cool/gross .</p>
<p>Posted  19 Sep 2012: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data (<a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/09/20/maximum-likelihood-estimation-of-frequencies-of-known-haplotypes-from-pooled-sequence-data/ ">Haldane's Sieve</a>)- a really interesting bit of software which may be useful for haplotype reconstruction in metagenomics and pooled sequencing experiments. I plan to give this a whirl and feedback to the authors my findings.</p>
<p>Posted 1 Oct 2012: Best Practices for Scientific Computing  (<a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/10/05/best-practices-for-scientific-computing/">Haldane's Sieve</a>) - not specifically microbial or biological but a useful treatise on how to write better code which would be useful for those writing bioinformatics software and pipelines, or even just doing analysis.</p>
<p>So, a little taster there.</p>
<p>Make no mistake - these are all <strong>quality manuscripts</strong>, they aren't being dumped there because they couldn't get past the PLoS ONE reviewers, or something equally banal.</p>
<p>Why are they there? My interpretation is that these authors <em>get it</em> and are posting to arXiv to take advantage of the <a href="http://haldanessieve.org/faq/#q2">particular benefits</a> of using a preprint server. Firstly, the immediacy of getting your work out there - simply submit the PDF and it's available to everyone. Your manuscript then gets a permanent home with a citable DOI. Submitting to arXiv may help with establishing priority.</p>
<p>For me, even more useful than these things are the benefits of publishing to a self-selected audience who are genuinely interested in this subject, and actively wish to read and critique such papers out of professional curiosity, not just because they are lucky/unlucky enough to be selected as peer reviewers. On arXiv, the "vibe" seems much different to that of the now-closed <a href="http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>, which sometimes honestly did feel like a dumping ground for unloved or hurried manuscripts.</p>
<p>A potential worry for these authors is that although they have deposited in arXiv, the community as a whole may not be looking there-- arXiv is not archived by PubMed-- and so they may not be cited by others routinely because they weren't seen. Hence this blog post, a small attempt to draw attention to this exciting development!</p>
<p>So I've talked a lot about arXiv - where does <a href="http://haldanessieve.org/">Haldane's Sieve</a> come in? This is simply a blog site run by Graham Coop, Bryan Howie and Joe Pickrell. It is important because arXiv provide no facilities for permitting comments on manuscripts, preferring that individual communities figure out the best way to discuss articles (and sensibly recognising this may not be a single place, something that even the open-access publishers can't really understand).</p>
<p>In maths and physics this is usually done on listservs, but in genomics and biology I guess we are more comfortable with the blog format for discussion hence the choice of WordPress. Haldane's Sieve finds new postings on arXiv, mainly in the field of population genetics, and then posts summary articles for you to comment on. It may be in the future we need a similar site for microbial genomics and ecology, but for now it's not so busy that this nascent community needs splitting up. Another place to find links is Twitter, e.g. by <a href="http://twitter.com/pathogenomenick">following me</a> (shameless link).</p>
<p>It seems to be working; the discussion of Lenski's paper has already generated a <a href="http://haldanessieve.org/2012/10/02/horizontal-gene-transfer-may-explain-variation-in-%ce%b8s/comment-page-1/#comment-387">vigorous response from Inigo Martincorena</a>, the likes of which you are unlikely to see in a published journal, and all the better for it's frankness and energy-- in my opinion.</p>
<p>So, in summary, you should add Haldane's Sieve and the arXiv qBio category (<a href="http://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio">http://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio</a>) to your feed reader if you want to spot exciting new articles and comment on them, and why not think about sending your next manuscript to arXiv first? (No, it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy">doesn't prevent you publishing</a> in peer-reviewed journals)</p>
