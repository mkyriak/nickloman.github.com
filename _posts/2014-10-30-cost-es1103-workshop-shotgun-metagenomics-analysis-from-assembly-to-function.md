*University of Birmingham*, 10th - 12th December

Organisers:
 - Dr Nick Loman (University of Birmingham)
 - Dr Chris Quince (University of Warwick)

Details:

This workshop will focus on the emerging technology of shotgun metagenomics techniques, with a focus on bioinformatics steps including de novo assembly, contig clustering/binning and functional analysis of the resulting dataset.  The challenges of very large genome assemblies will be discussed, with reference to normalization, partitioning and use of very large memory servers. Assembly technologies considered will include Ray, Meta-IDBA and MetaVelvet. The use of CONCOCT, a novel algorithm that clusters genomes based on coverage and composition will be demonstrated. Challenges of functional and taxonomic assignments of resulting genome bins will be discussed, with reference to KEGG, PROKKA etc.

This course would suit biologists with familiarity with bioinformatics software and the UNIX command line. Preference will be given to those users who have already generated large shotgun metagenomics datasets. There will be opportunities to analyse real participant data on provided large-memory virtual machines.

Fifteen funded places providing a stipend of Â£500 for accommodation and travel are available to researchers and students working in an EU member state through the COST project ES1103 (<http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/essem/Actions/ES1103>).
Application deadline: 1st November 2014

Non-COST funded applicants are also welcome, although these participants will have to pay their own way. Application deadline for these applicants is: 7th November 2014
