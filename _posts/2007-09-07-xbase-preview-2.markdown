<p>Did we say Monday? Anyway, the second preview of xBASE 2.0 is now available <a href="http://watson.bham.ac.uk:8003/">here</a>. As always, we would be very grateful for your comments and suggestions either in the blog comments section, or directly to me via email at <a href="mailto:n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk">n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk</a>. Please note as it is a preview there will still be bugs and missing features. At the point they are ironed out, we will be putting the new site live!</p>
