There are two options: high output mode, or rapid run mode.

NEXTERA XT

For either workflow you will need Nextera XT kits (works out at £25/sample for library prep for 96 samples)

1x FC-131-1096 1,823.73
1x FC-131-2001 643.00

HIGH OUTPUT MODE

Single flow cell.

Output: up to 500 gigabases (V4 chemistry)
Read length: 2x125

1 x FC-401-4003 £6,249.00
1 x PE-401-4001 £3,858.00

So looking at £10,107 to do this equivalent to £20/gigabase.

RAPID RUN MODE

Output: up to 180 gigabases (dual flow cells)
Read length: 2x150

2 x PE-402-4001 £1612.60
3 x FC-402-4001 £3339.63

£4952.23 or £27/gigabase.

To be confident of success you should do a test run on the MiSeq first:

1 x MS-102-2002 £615.60
