<p>I wanted to draw attention to this meeting in June which I am helping to organise.</p>
<p>The idea is to look at how genomics data from high-throughput sequencing can be used for public health microbiology. As a major impediment to routine adoption of this technology is the bioinformatic analysis we want to look in detail at this problem. We'll also be thinking what impact the new sequencing machines such as Ion Torrent, MiSeq and PacBio may have on making sequencing a routine public health intervention.</p>
<p>I think it should be a good meeting - apart from the great speakers we have lined up, the venue is very nice. Hinxton Hall is in the grounds of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute campus, in the middle of the countryside - with the <a href="http://www.redlionhinxton.co.uk/">Red Lion</a> but a few minutes walk away, ready to serve up a foaming pint!</p>

1-3 June 2011</p>
<p>The aim of this Conference is to provide a multidisciplinary forum to highlight recent scientific and technological advances in bioinformatics and microbiology/virology, and to consider how these might be translated to match the developing needs for public health.</p>
<p>Target audience:</p>
<p>*   Public Health professionals (including zoonotics, microbiologists/virologists, researchers and Public Health specialists)<br />
*   Epidemiologists and informatics specialists<br />
*   Bioinformatics researchers, technologists and computer scientists<br />
*   Microbiological researches and  technologists</p>
<p>Abstract deadline: 25 April 2011<br />
Registration deadline: 9 May 2011</p>
