<p>Are any readers going to the <a href="https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=121">Applied Bioinformatics and Public Health Meeting</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">next week</span> tomorrow in Hinxton, UK? The theme is Opportunities and Challenges of ‘Next Generation’ Sequencing in Public Health Microbiology and should be particularly useful for microbiologists and bioinformaticians looking at microbial sequencing from the point of view of developing new epidemiological and diagnostic methods for use in the clinical laboratory. If you are going please say hello. If you have not heard of this meeting, registration is apparently still open according to the website. If you can't make it check back here next week - I will try and post a few updates to capture the flavour of the meeting.</p>
