  content: "Hi Nick, \r\n\r\nI hope you are well. \r\n\r\nI would be interested in
    attending these events and can give quite a lot of info to people on what other
    similar establishments are doing  and I speak to most of them. Also I can offer
    cost prices on the IT kit people are buying so they can negotiate better. \r\n\r\nIf
    people want to buy from me I would just add 8%. \r\n\r\nI am based in edgbaston.
    \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nJames Hayes\r\n\r\nDNA DATA Ltd\r\n\r\n07858 062598"
