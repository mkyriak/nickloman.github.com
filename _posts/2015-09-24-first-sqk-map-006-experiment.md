We've just finally found the time to break open the new SQK-MAP-006
kits from Oxford Nanopore. These kits are notable because they
introduce the first really major changes to the chemistry for some time.

   * First up, the speed has been doubled from ~30 bp/s to ~75 bp/s
   * Secondly, the previous hair-pin motor complex has been jettisoned
     and replaced with a new motor that can stall both the template
     and the complement strand.

As is typical, we wanted to try it out with our usual reference strain,
*E. coli* K-12 MG1655. The run has been on since about 17:00 today, and you can view its progress via the amazing MinoTour software from Matt Loose, visit:

This site has a bunch of cool visualisations of live streaming data that you
can observe and interact with.

I'll update this post as the run progresses and we take a look at the
data.

As always, thanks to Josh Quick for his masterful library preparation
technique.
