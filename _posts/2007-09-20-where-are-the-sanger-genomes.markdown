<p>We're aware that a number of our users are very keen to continue analysing the unfinished genomes from the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk">Sanger Institute</a> which were in previous versions of <em>coli</em>BASE etc. but are missing from the new <em>x</em>BASE. We are working on getting these sequences back into<em> x</em>BASE as a priority. One thing that is important is that we are able to track updates and gene identifiers from version to version, so that as these genomes progress and become finished and published, your research can use a set of unified gene identifiers. This reduces confusion going forward and makes it easy to be sure you are working on the right gene!</p>
<p>xBASE release 22 (including the Sanger genomes) and a software update to xBASE to include restoration of the pattern match facility is currently targeted for Monday 24th September 2007.</p>
<p>Please keep your comments and feedback coming on the new version!</p>
