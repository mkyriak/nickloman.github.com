<p>I just got back from a short meeting in the States. Even though I was only out of the office a few days, I am now even further behind with backed-up peer review, finishing manuscript drafts, collaborations. My long-suffering family now have to cope with me being tired and irritable while I catch up on missed sleep and adjusting back to local time. And I can see several more weeks out of the office coming before Christmas.</p>
<p>During the meeting dinner I fell to discussing the pressures of attending all these meetings and keeping sane with <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10000354">Julie Segre</a>, an investigator at the NIH. It was great to meet Julie, who is one of the genome detectives featured in Carl Zimmer's inspiring article <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/ff-kpc-superbug-nih/">Mutants</a>. She told me her brilliant scheme for dealing with academic invitations -- she has seven questions she will ask of every invitation. Unless all the answers are yes, she will decline.</p>
<p>I thought this was such a good idea, I asked her to send them to me to share on this blog.</p>
<p>Over to Julie!</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I think the important part is to formulate your own questions and revisit as your life changes. I have switched the order of these questions at different times.  Right now, I'm wondering why the invitation being an honor is so high on my list – I think this was intended to capture the times that it is grad students inviting me rather than some committee.  My important criteria are:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px;"><br />
1. Is the person inviting me someone whom I really like or owe a favor?<br />
2. Will I meet people that I need/want to meet?<br />
3. Is this invitation really an honor?<br />
4. Have I already agreed to other trips during this time period?<br />
5. Do I completely understand the commitment; e.g. If this is a review of a candidate, is it just on paper or does it require a travel to the site?<br />
If I agree to be on the program committee will I have to review 100+ abstracts?<br />
6. Is the trip somewhere that I really want to go? (What is the travel time? Are there direct flights?)<br />
7. Have I checked with my spouse?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I say 'no' and don't feel bad.  I truly enjoy my open days with protected time.  I find that writing this down and making myself go through these questions has helped to separate the things that I want to do from things that I should do from things that I really need to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Blog away – others have loved this idea, although I'm not sure they have adopted it.  I've tried to make a similar decision making tree to pick a journal for submission, but I have yet to understand that rather irrational process.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I think this is great advice. I am really grateful for Julie for letting me post these.</p>
<p>Saying no is always a difficult thing to do, but I realise it is actually vital if you want to keep control of your work, family and sanity! I will adapt Julie's list and try and stick to it as my New Year's resolution.</p>
