<p>It's that time again! Balti and bioinformatics will return .. on Monday, 20th May 2013. Not dissimilar to last time, we will feature complimentary samosas from Smethwick's finest sweet shop, and hopefully without the bit where about 40 people had to crowd into my office. Spaces will be limited, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19CJXKdMq_mOwnlVrcTR1LbUdcr-E9hFVRHn4fqx-QUg/viewform">register to attend via the Google web form</a> (it's free!).</p>
