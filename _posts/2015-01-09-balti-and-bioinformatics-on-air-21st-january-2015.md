The plan this year for the triumphant **Balti and Bioinformatics**
series is to alternate between virtual, "on-air" meetings (where
sadly you will need to provide your own balti curry) and real 
life ones which will be mainly held in Birmingham, but may be
in other places in England or Wales. Ideally I would plan to run
6 meetings a year.

So ... to kick us off:

**Balti and Bioinformatics On-Air**

This meeting's theme is *open data and reproducible bioinformatics*.
