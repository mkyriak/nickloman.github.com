<p>In case you didn't see the announcement already, the <a href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_2000.ilmn">Illumina HiSeq</a> can produce 200 gigabases of sequence data and 2 billion reads per run. When it was launched we knew that BGI in China had signed an agreement to buy 128 of these machines but no-one has fessed up to owning one just yet. Things might have changed today. Two updates to the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/">map of high-throughput sequencers</a>, one hot on the heels of the other are both advertising HiSeq capability in Europe. <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/centres/gatc/">GATC</a> and <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/centres/dnavision-sa/">DNAvision</a>, both service companies have updated the map to say they have a HiSeq machine ready and waiting to service customers. Their corporate websites are a bit less clear on whether it has actually arrived yet, indicating just that the HiSeq has <a href="http://www.gatc-biotech.com/en/about-us/press/press-release-single-view/press-release/2010/01/21/article/gatc-biotech-orders-europes-first-hiseq-2000-for-commercial-use-131.html">been</a> <a href="http://www.dnavision.be/uploadedPDF/DNAVISION_PressRelease_IlluminaHiSeq2000_050210%20finale2.pdf?c=114385&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1197460&amp;highlight=">ordered</a>.</p>
<p>We work predominantly on bacterial genomes so this throughput is probably overkill for sequencing <em>E. coli</em>, but the dynamic range for applications such as RNA-Seq and CHiP-Seq is going to be absolutely unbelievable.</p>
