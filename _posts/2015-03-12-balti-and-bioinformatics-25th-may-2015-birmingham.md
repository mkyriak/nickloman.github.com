## Tuesday, 5th May 2015

University of Birmingham Campus (building tbc)

13:00 - 16:30, then straight off for a curry.

### "Revenge of the Commonwealth"

I'd quite like to bring this balti and bioinformatics meeting
"back to basics". The last few have got quite large, and talk-
heavy, whereas I originally envisaged these meetings as a community
forum for bioinformaticians to talk openly about problems they were
encountering, and get the benefit of a diverse group of people
struggling with their own problems. And hopefully to make strong connections
that would outlast the meeting and lead to collaborations or
self-help groups etc.

But we will have great talks to, and this is your opportunity to answer
the question which is very much to the front of any British person's
mind, namely: which of the ex-colonies are managing better without
us, Australia or Canada?

So I am going to limit the number and length of talks down a bit,
and try and carve out some more structured and unstructured discussion
time which would include "solve my problem" sessions and also just more
discussion generally, and perhaps cap the numbers to something
like 50.

Email me suggested topics.
