## Tuesday, 5th May 2015

13:00 - 16:30, then straight off for a curry.

### "Revenge of the Commonwealth"

I'd quite like to bring this balti and bioinformatics meeting
"back to basics". The last few have got quite large, and talk-
heavy, whereas I originally envisaged these meetings as a forum
for bioinformaticians to talk openly about problems they were
encountering, and get the benefit of a diverse group of people
struggling with their own problems.

So I am going to limit the number of talks to just five, and
try and carve out some more structured discussion time which
would include "solve my problem" sessions and also just more
discussion generally, and perhaps cap the numbers to something
like 50.

Email me suggested topics.

Talks:

Jennifer Gardy, BC CDC

Ana Crisan, BC CDC

Jen Guthrie, BC CDC

Torsten Seemann, University of Melbourne

Simon Gladman, University of Melbourne

CLIMB update, Nick Loman
