<p>The BBSRC have done a nice job making a short video about the <a href="https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki">E. coli O104:H4 outbreak crowd-sourcing project</a>, featuring little old me as well as the far more telegenic Lisa Crossman. Check it out, it's got some spooky music too.</p>

<p>Also please check out the <a href="http://oadb.tsl.ac.uk/">OpenAshDieBack crowd-sourcing project</a> currently ongoing, coordinated by the chaps at the John Innes Centre, The Sainsbury Lab and TGAC.</p>
