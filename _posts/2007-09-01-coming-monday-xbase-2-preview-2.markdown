<p>We're getting ready to show the second preview of xBASE 2 (confusing, I know!). This version features over 1000 bacterial genomes (complete and incomplete) and a much more powerful taxonomy browser. We've also beefed up the search engine, revamped the front-end user interface and added a few nice other features such as integration with <a href="http://www.genomesonline.org">GOLD</a>. We'll unveil the second preview early Monday, and all being well it will replace the current xBASE sites and become the "full launch" version, after we've gathered a bit more user feedback.</p>
