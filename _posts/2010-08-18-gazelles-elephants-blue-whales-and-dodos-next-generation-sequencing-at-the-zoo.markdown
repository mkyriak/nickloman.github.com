  content: i am sorry , but the parting shot about helicos is just plain ridiculuous....the
    RNA research published only 2 weeks ago in Nature represents possibily the most
    major breakthrough in sequencing in recent memory.....a "dodo"...who are you kidding?..

  content: Ah, well, please take the comment in the spirit it was intended - perhaps
    a little tongue-in-cheek, but Helicos as a business is looking a little shakey
    right now (see http://www.google.co.uk/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:HLCS). I
    agree that Nature paper was very interesting, perhaps that deserves a blog post
    too.

    $1M a pop. They realized quickly enough and smartly changed directions - aiming
    for the lucrative diagnostics market. Their technology is very interesting and
    capable of doing what no one else can (yet). At a $50M market cap, don't be surprised
    to see them gobbled up soon as well.\r\n\r\nThey're not dodos over there. A recent

  content: I like to think of the gen 2 systems as giant fighting dinosuars, 'G per
    run - grr - arggh' etc, a volcano of data spewing behind them in a Jurassic landscape
    - Sequanosaurus Rex.  Meanwhile,  in the undergrowth, the gen 3 ' mammals' are
    quietly getting on with evolving and adapting to the imminent climate change.....smaller,
    faster, agile and more intelligent...

  content: "I see no official or validated performance spec published anywhere, just
    conjecture from comments made during Rothberg's weird talk at AGBT.  When the
    early access customers give specs, then I think I can believe them.  Until then
    marketing can give vague performance specs.  I agree they must have been promising
    enough for Life to spend so much money, so maybe the Gazelle is appropriate!\r\n\r\nThe
    price point of the purchase would make it hard to sell a cheap sequencer.  How
    many $50K sequencers and consumables would you have to sell to make back the investment
    and turn a profit?  The first $50K sequencer may be the overseas rip-off of the
    technology where they did not have to incur the developmental costs.  All in all
    this will be a great story to watch!"

<p>The big news today is that Life Tech, of SOLiD fame intend to acquire <a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/">Ion Torrent</a>, subject to certain technical milestones being reached. The best blog coverage is at <a href="http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2010/08/life-tech-gobbles-ion-torrent.html">Omics Omics</a> and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/geneticfuture/~3/3zZOnx8_H8c/ion_torrent_bought_by_life_tec.php">Genetic Future</a>.</p>
<p>This means Illumina, Life Tech and Roche, our sequencing Big Three have all now got into bed with "next-next-generation" technology platforms. Roche have previously signed up <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/roche-ibm-co-developing-nanopore-based-dna-sequencing-technology">IBM's  nanopore technology</a> and Illumina have entered into a <a href="http://investor.illumina.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=121127&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1242758&amp;highlight=">marketing and distribution alliance</a> with Oxford Nanopore.</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>Each platform holder is trying to balance their portfolio and position for the future. Roche are struggling to get much more throughput from the 454 platform and so it makes sense that they focus on the potentially superior nanopore platform. This is some way off, <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com//node/946828?hq_e=el&amp;hq_m=786781&amp;hq_l=6&amp;hq_v=0091267ed2">perhaps 5-7 years</a>.  Roche's portfolio has got a big hole the middle right now.</p>
<p>Illumina are dominant but are also looking to the future. Oxford Nanopore looks like a sensible alliance, and I'd predict we'll see it hit in about 3 years time.</p>
<p>By snapping up Ion Torrent, Life Tech have gone for a quite different technology which looks much more likely to integrate happily into the clinical diagnostics market. As announced, Ion Torrent's closest competitor is the 454 Jr.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ion Torrent system is rather similar to the 454 sequencing system in many ways (not surprising as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rothberg">Jonathan Rothberg</a> started 454 as well as Ion Torrent).  Ion Torrent's main advantage is price, clocking  in at $50-100k for the instrument and $500 a run in consumables. It's also fast, a  promised 1 hour per run (but still a day for sample prep). But this  isn't single molecule and the throughput is low, clocking in at 100Mb.  This is a gazelle: fast, agile, but relatively weak.</p>
<p>But Life Tech have also announced another in-house technology called <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/new_players_in_sequencing_debu.php">quantum dot single-molecule sequencing</a> (more <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/life-technologies-sees-bright-future-quantum-dots-g3-sequencer">here</a>), and covered their bases well.</p>
<p>A more practical consideration is that the term "next-generation sequencing" is dead. It's all getting way too confusing. Despite my expectation that technology should progress linearly and result in steady improvements in each areas, this isn't the case. Right now you can pick and choose from a menu of options. You can have direct sequencing (single molecule), faster sequencing, faster sample prep, higher throughput, longer reads, cheaper, but you can't have it all.</p>
<p>Continuing the animal analogy; SOLiD and HiSeq are now looking like elephants (or rhinos, or hippos) - powerful, but slow and cumbersome.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave us:</p>

<p>Before you prompt me: where does the PacBio RS sit? Well, in view of its size - perhaps this should be the blue whale. And Helicos, alas is perhaps the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">dodo</a>.</p>
