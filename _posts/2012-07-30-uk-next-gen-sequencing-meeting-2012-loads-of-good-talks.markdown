Shameless plug alert, I promise I'll get back to more in-depth blogging sometime soon!</p>
<p>If you haven't already, please <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/deepseq/events.aspx">register for the UK NGS Meeting 2012</a> held in Nottingham, UK on August 28-30. This is the third incarnation of this relaxed meeting which has a diverse cross-section of NGS talks. There are particularly strong talks in the Pathogens strand this year, which I am helping organise. A few talks I am particularly looking forward to with a microbial theme include:</p>
<p><strong>Dave Rasko</strong>, University of Maryland; <em>"Application of whole genome sequencing to microbial forensics and diagnostic development"</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Gardy</strong>, British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, <em>"The field guide to pathogens: using next generation sequencing to improve public health microbiology"</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Zamin Iqbal</strong>, University of Oxford, <em>"High-­‐throughput population genomics using de novo variant assembly: examples from pathogen and human genomics"</em></p>
<p>The meeting will also have talks from Chris Quince (of <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2010/08/come-on-feel-the-pyronoise/">PyroNoise/AmpliconNoise</a> fame), Mike Quail (WTSI), Matt Berriman (WTSI), Ed Feil (Bath) .. and even myself! :)</p>
<p>Should be a fun couple of days, and of course this meeting is renowned for spilling out into Nottingham's city centre which features a number of excellent hostelries, including "England's oldest pub", <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Trip_To_Jerusalem">Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem</a>. Neil Hall, the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2012/02/a-new-sequencing-technology-enters-the-ring-shtseqtm/">CEO of SHTseq</a>, has said the first round is on him!</p>
<p>Twitter hashtag will is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23UKNGS2012">#UKNGS2012</a>.</p>
<p>Hope you can join us!</p>
