<p>The links between some chronic infections and cancer are well established – think of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and gastric cancer – and a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nm.2015.html">recent paper in Nature Medicine</a> shows that a common human colonic bacterium can cause cancer in a mouse model. The bacterium involved, enterotoxigenic <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> (ETBF), secretes a metalloprotease toxin (fragilysin) and can cause inflammatory diarrhoeal disease, but also asymptomatically colonises as a commensal in a significant proportion of the human population. The authors, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, show that the colitis caused by ETBF strongly induced colonic tumors in cancer-susceptible multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice and describe a novel mechanism involving the endogenous T cell immune response. They suggest that ETBF is a human oncogenic bacterium and that this ties-in with a <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118633169/abstract">previous study</a> indicating an increased prevalence of ETBF in colorectal cancer patients.</p>
