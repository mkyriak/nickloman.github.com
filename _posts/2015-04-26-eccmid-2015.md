I am at the incredibly impressive and huge <a href="http://www.eccmidlive.org">ECCMID</a> meeting in Copenhagen.

I've given a talk already, and I am doing a "Meet-the-Expert" session
tomorrow. My talk is viewable here:

Tomorrow I am doing a "Meet-the-Expert" session about what tools to use
for bacterial genome analysis, feel free to look at my slides in advance
and ask some questions (even if you aren't at ECCMID!)

One thing that is noticeable about this conference is how incredibly
high-tech the conference website is. Talks are posted in near-real-time
after they are given.

Here are some you should definitely check out!
