<p>Apologies for the xBASE downtime from Friday, 19th October until 10am this morning. There was a flood in one of the Birmingham University's network rooms (thankfully, not ours) which affected all network access to our servers. Unfortunately the problem was entirely out of our control, but normal service should resume from now.</p>
