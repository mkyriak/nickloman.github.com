<p>The ritual of checking Twitter with my coffee this morning brought <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=illumina+sequencing">much excited chattering</a> about the new Illumina sequencer, the HiSeq 2000 which was announced yesterday. I won't cover this in detail as there are already great blog posts up from <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/01/illumina_announces_new_arrival.php">Daniel McArthur</a>, <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2010/01/hiseq-2000.html">David Dooling</a> and <a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/01/12/another-stop-on-the-road-to-the-1000-genome/">Genomics Lawyer</a>. Bottom-line: $650,000 for the machine, $10,000 for the reagents, 2 x 100 base-pair paired-reads and the clincher, <strong>200Gb</strong> of sequence data per run. And a terrible name.</p>
<p>Technology wise this has been done through parallelisation rather than chemistry changes. Illumina have increased the number of flow-cells in each run to 2. Each of these are now double-sided, and the readable area of the flow-cell has been increased. This is a bit like the processor market where Intel have managed to keep pace with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</a> by increasing the number of processor cores on each chip.</p>
<p>The other big news is that <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/centres/beijing-genomics-institute/">Beijing Genomics Institute</a> have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/12/genome-illumina-sequencing-business-healthcare-cancer-autism.html?partner=yahootix">ordered 128 of these beasts</a>, which on delivery will hand them the title of largest genome centre in the world by a country mile. According to the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/">map of high-throughput sequencers</a>, the Broad Institute currently hold this title. Although no doubt we will see a bunch of other genome centres placing orders for this new machine soon.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>For those with GA2s looking to upgrade, I am told that trading in your old machine will give you a paltry $150,000 off the list price of the HiSeq.</p>
