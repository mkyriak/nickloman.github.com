<p>I don't normally post job ads on the blog, but I was sent this interesting sounding opportunity which might suit one of the readers of this blog? Note they are accepting late submissions, but get your application in quickly!</p>
<p>KESS Scholarship</p>
<p>Aberystwyth University are seeking to recruit a 1-year MPhil to work on a project entitled:<br />
Developing an integrated whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing method to<br />
characterise Cryptosporidium clinical isolates</p>
<p>The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium species cause severe, sometimes fatal, gastroenteritis in<br />
children and adults. Cryptosporidiosis is a public health problem in Wales and worldwide. Only three<br />
Cryptosporidium species have been genome sequenced and published to date, and very little is known<br />
about the sub-types and diversity of Cryptosporidium species.</p>
<p>This project has two aims. The first is to develop a technique to recover oocysts from clinical samples,<br />
and characterise the Cryptosporidium genomic DNA by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), to allow<br />
strain and species differences between isolates to be determined. The second aim is to apply the<br />
optimized isolation and sequencing technique to a selection of clinical samples from outbreaks in<br />
Wales and the UK.</p>
<p>This project will involve close collaboration between the Cryptosporidium Reference Unit (CRU) and<br />
Aberystwyth University (AU), with the student performing immunomagnetic seperation (IMS) to purify<br />
oocysts from clinical samples, and DNA extraction from captured oocysts at the CRU, and subsequent<br />
DNA manipulation, whole genome amplification, NGS and bioinformatics steps at AU.<br />
The student will also be expected to present the results of the project at scientific meetings both in<br />
Wales and the UK, and possibly at international meetings. The results of this work are expected to be<br />
published in peer reviewed journals.</p>
<p>The prospective applicant should have a minimum of a 1st or good 2:1 in a relevant degree, and be<br />
available to take up the studentship by 1 October 2013. The prospective applicant should also not hold<br />
or currently be working towards a qualification at Master’s Degree level or higher. The project is partfunded<br />
by the European Social Fund (ESF) through the European Union’s Convergence programme<br />
administered by the Welsh Government. KESS scholarships are collaborative awards with external<br />
partners. (Applicants need only apply, they do not need to search for partners.)<br />
To apply, please submit the following to the Postgraduate Admissions Office (address below) by 13<br />
September 2013:<br />
1. A completed Research Programme Application Form, two references. Application and reference<br />
forms may be downloaded from http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/postgrad/howtoapply/.<br />
2. A completed KESS application form (put the reference number AU50014 in the top right hand box of<br />
the application form) and an up-to-date CV. KESS application forms are available to download at the<br />
link below.<br />
www.aber.ac.uk/en/ccs/staff-students/funding/kess/<br />
3. A Personal Statement of up to 1,000 words where you expand on your experience and interests and<br />
describe why you are a good candidate for this research studentship. Please refer to the Project<br />
Description.<br />
Value of Award: A stipend of £10,130. Each scholarship has an additional budget for travel,<br />
equipment/consumables and training to support your research. KESS Scholarship holders do not pay<br />
fees.</p>
<p>Length: Full-time for 1 year. (Theses must be submitted 3 months after the funded one year study<br />
period.)</p>
<p>Training: The achievement of a Postgraduate Skills Development Award (PSDA) is compulsory for each<br />
KESS scholar (The PSDA is based on a 30 credit award, which is an additional award to the MPhil).<br />
Eligibility: To be eligible to apply for a KESS award, you must be resident, upon application, in the<br />
Convergence Area of Wales and you must be able to take paid employment in the Convergence area<br />
on completion of the scholarship.</p>
<p>The Convergence Area means the following counties of Wales:<br />
Blaenau Gwent<br />
Bridgend<br />
Caerphilly<br />
Carmarthenshire<br />
Ceredigion<br />
Conwy<br />
Denbighshire<br />

Isle of Anglesey<br />
Merthyr Tydfil<br />
Neath Port Talbot<br />
Pembrokeshire<br />
Rhondda Cynon Taff<br />
Swansea<br />
Torfaen</p>
<p>For further student eligibility criteria related to the individual projects, please view the details of the<br />
individual project above.</p>
