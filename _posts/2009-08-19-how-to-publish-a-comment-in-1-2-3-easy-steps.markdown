<p>The article <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/upload/2009/08/how_to_publish_a_scientific_co/How%20to%20Publish%20a%20Comment.pdf">How To Publish a Scientific Comment in 1, 2, 3 Easy Steps</a> by Rick Trebino is very funny, enough to make me share it here (re-tweeted by <a href="http://twitter.com/phylogenomics">Jonathan Eisen</a>). It was disturbing enough before you realise it actually happened to the author!</p>
