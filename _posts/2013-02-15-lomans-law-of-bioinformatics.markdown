<p>Loman's (first) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/258588338452307969">law of bioinformatics</a> states: If you haven't found at least one serious bug in the bioinformatics pipeline you are re-using then you don't yet understand it.</p>
<p>Loman's second law of pipelines: By the time you've got someone elses pipeline working to your satisfaction you could have written your own.</p>
<p>Loman's <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/266563680810971136">third law</a> of bioinformatics: you don't always need the best tool, you need the tool you best understand</p>
<p>Loman's <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/320839652581994496">fourth law of bioinformatics</a>: try it out on a thousand sequences before you try it on 100 million</p>
<p>The fifth law either hasn't been discovered yet, or I have forgotten it.</p>
<p>Loman's <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/356674281184301056">sixth law of bioinformatics: Metadata first, then data.</a></p>
