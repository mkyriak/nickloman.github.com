  content: Hi Niall - no problem! If you can put up the link so that your audience
    can view and update the map if they want afterwards that would be really helpful.

  content: "Hi Nick, \r\nI work with a 454 and I am wondering if anyone has ever tought
    of the fact that 454 sells less machines thant Illumina also because for a sequencing
    run you just need 8-10 hrs instead of a week or more with the GAII or SOLiD?\r\n454
    is obviously not in direct competition w the other 2 sequencers because they have
    specific niches (de-novo vs resequencing)at least regarding sequencing DNA.\r\nWhat
    I wanna say is that everybody think Illumina is the best just because it sells
    more, but even if I am going to buy an HiSeq2000 myself in the near future, I
    think that it sells more basicly because the machine take too long to do its job.
    If the GA or HiSeq d have the same run time of a 454 run, then maybe we could
    really compare the quality of a technology vs the other one.\r\nIn our lab the
    454 is sitting there for the most of the time simply because it takes much more
    to prepare the libraries etc than the actual run, so there is no need to by more
    than one unless you have enough people in the wet lab to produce an enourmous
    amount of libraries ready for sequencing all the time. WIth Illumina the problem
    is the opposite: it takes much more to perform the run than to prepare the DNA
    for sequencing, so the machines are busy all the time, and if you have enough
    to sequence you will obviously need to buy more GAs..."

<p>Yesterday, we launched a new version of the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts">high-throughput sequencing map</a>. I promised when it launched that when sufficient updates were received we would release instrument statistics. We have now received 214 updates from the community - thank you so much! So, without further ado, <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/stats">check out the statistics tables</a>!</p>
<p>Some bottom-line numbers: there are (as of a minute ago) <strong>669</strong> machines listed in the database, spanning <strong>250</strong> sequencing facilities, an average of 2.7 machines per centre (a bit like a UK family having an average of 2.4 children!)</p>
<p>The take-home message which won't surprise anyone is that <strong>Illumina are still dominating the market-place</strong>. 406 GA2s are accounted for, making up about 60% of our sample. This means they have shipped nearly four times as many sequencers as their two main rivals, Roche's 454 and Life Technologies' SOLiD.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interestingly is the battle for 2nd place. According to our sample Roche are just edging SOLiD with 118 machines to 110 but the competition is intense. This indicates that SOLiD have made up a huge amount of ground in the past year or two. Pretty good for a machine we wrote off as being the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2009/08/abi-challenge-sanger-centre/">"worst of both worlds"</a> last August. It is not clear to me how they have managed this impressive feat (although I have heard some rather uncharitable possibilities from people), but it is good news for Life Technologies that they have stayed in the game and are apparently gaining traction. The battle ain't over yet.</p>
<p>About half the 454 and Solexas are in dedicated genome centres like the Broad, BGI and the Sanger Centre, but only about a third of SOLiDs are in dedicated genome centres, suggesting this platform has gained popularity in the smaller facilities. The largest SOLiD installation that we know about is at the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/centres/institute-for-molecular-bioscience-university-of-queensland/">University of Queensland</a> with 11 machines.</p>
<p>There's much less good news for Helicos - the Heliscope's early entrance into the so-called "3rd generation" market appears to have gained virtually no traction in the market at all, with only 8 machines accounted for on the map.</p>
<p>Country-wise, the US still dominates the world with 46% of the machines in North America. We are pleased to see that the UK is well-represented with 95 machines and 29 facilities, although there is probably a bias as we hail from these isles.</p>
<p>China are the current world #3 in terms of sequencing machines but this is likely to change very soon when BGI start taking delivery of their HiSeq 2000 instruments, with 128 apparently on pre-order. Hopefully someone from BGI will come and update the map when they arrive.</p>
<p>And of course, we expect this map to have a few new faces in a years time with at least Pacific Biosystems and perhaps Ion Torrent bringing their products to market.</p>
<p>No doubt you can find other interesting nuggets in the stats, please feel free to share them in the comments.</p>
<p>Finally, a plea. If you see inaccurate or missing information on the map, please don't complain, just get involved! This is a community resource that relies on your help. It's really easy to add and update details on the map and if you have problems just get in touch.</p>
<p>One last caveat, I am not saying there are only 669 machines in the wild, the real number is conservatively likely to be 4- or 5-times this. We want to confront this problem head on and find out exactly what sampling we have got to help know how far the map has to go before it is complete.</p>
<p>Therefore we have set up the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/serial">the great high-throughput sequencing serial number challenge</a>. Taking inspiration from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem">German tank problem</a> we wish to accurately estimate the numbers of machines shipped by reference to machine serial numbers. This was inspired by a recent thread on SeqAnswers.com. By allowing anonymous submissions we hope to collect a statistically useful set of serial numbers. Help us out, please <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/serial">visit the site</a> and help us out by submitting your serial numbers!</p>
