<p>If you are into sequencing, genomics and bioinformatics, here are a couple of must-attend dates for your diary!</p>
<p>This September, kicking off the second "conference season" of the year, is <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/deepseq/events.aspx">UK Genome Science 2013</a>. This is one of the largest meet-ups of genomics people in the UK. I like to say it is our version of AGBT, minus the sun, tropical island, palm-trees, pelicans, free booze, all-night parties, exclusive suites with hot-tubs, Jay Flatley playing beer pong. Instead, Nottingham boasts some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Trip_To_Jerusalem">oldest</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Salutation_Inn">pubs</a> in the land (and thus world) and a willing group of volunteers to show you around them. Excitingly, <strong>Clive Brown</strong>, CTO of Oxford Nanopore will be giving the keynote, and hopefully updating us on the status of their <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2013/03/a-chat-with-oxford-nanopores-clive-brown-at-agbt-2013/">eagerly anticipated</a> single-molecule sequencer. There are sessions on bioinformatics, metagenomics, clinical application of HTS, pathogens, technologies and AgriFoods. Registration closes this <strong>Friday, 9th August</strong>, so please register soon!</p>
<p>The fun continues straight after this with another installation of our balti and bioinformatics meetings, this time rebranded for the summer as <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2013/07/cream-teas-and-bioinformatics-balti-and-bioinformatics-goes-on-its-holidays/">cream teas and bioinformatics</a>, and hosted by the good folk at the University of Exeter. Come for an informal discussion of the bioinformatics of sequencing, including an opportunity to ask questions of our speakers about your particular bioinformatics problems.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at one or both of these meetings!</p>
