<p>Sorry for the hiatus in news. We're beavering away to complete the new release of xBASE. We're targetting 1st August 2007 and not a day later, so please keep an eye out on the site. We'll be mailing all our regular users to let them know about it around then. The sites will be fresh with the latest completed genomes and sport an attractive new interface and a bunch of new functionality. Now, back to the code...</p>
