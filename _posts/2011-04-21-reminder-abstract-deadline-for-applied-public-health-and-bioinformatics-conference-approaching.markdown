<p>Just a quick reminder that the abstract deadline is fast approaching (Tuesday, April 26th) for the <a href="https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=227">Applied Public Health and Bioinformatics</a> conference at Hinxton Hall, Cambridge. If you haven't registered, I'd recommend doing so now. There's going to be some great talks including <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jennifergardy">Jennifer Gardy</a> talking about her recent NEJM paper on <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1003176">linking social networks with whole-genome sequencing of tuberculosis</a> plus the always compelling Julian Parkhill discussing his <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/430">recent <em>S. pneumoniae</em> paper</a> and no doubt other interesting studies.. There are scientific (rather than sales pitch) talks from the major sequencer manufacturers including Illumina, Pacific Biosciences and Life Tech / Ion Torrent. We're hoping that anyone doing good work using whole-genome sequencing for microbial diagnosis, surveillance or epidemiology will submit an abstract. We aim to pick a good number of talks from the submissions. Plus the conference is in the lovely, leafy Hinxton conference centre within walking distance to the <a href="http://www.redlionhinxton.co.uk/">Red Lion pub</a> and the Sanger Institute. Hope to see you there!</p>
