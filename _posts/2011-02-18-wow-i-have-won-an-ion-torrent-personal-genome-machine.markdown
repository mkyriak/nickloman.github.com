  content: "In this age of instant blogging, companies and the rest of us should adopt
    zero tolerance of sub-optimal press releases (http://www.lifetechnologies.com/news-gallery/press-releases/2011/life-techologies-aouces-visioary-wiers-of-the-io-torret-pgm-grat.html),
    so here is what I suggested Ion Torrent should use, which avoids putting words
    in my mouth and avoids typos and nonsensical statements.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife Technologies
    Announces Visionary Winners of the Ion Torrent PGM Grants Program in Europe\r\n\r\nWinning
    Submittals Highlight Potential Breakthrough Applications to Advance Human Health
    \ \r\n\r\nCARLSBAD, Calif. – Feb.  18, 2011 – Life Technologies Corporation  (NASDAQ:
    \ LIFE), today announced Dr. Angel Carracedo and Dr. Mark Pallen as the winners
    of the European Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM™) Sequencer Grants Program.
    \ \r\n\r\nEach scientist will receive an Ion PGM and because of the low costs
    and short run times of the Ion Torrent sequencing technology, these scientists
    will be able to give their labs real-time cost-effective flexibility in high-throughput
    sequencing of a sort unseen even in large core sequencing centers.\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    Ion Torrent has awarded three runners-up an Ion PGM sequencer to support their
    exceptional proposals.  This award will enable the visionary scientists to conduct
    further research at an accelerated rate.\r\n \r\n“In all of the proposals we saw
    innovative, often potentially breakthrough applications that were on the shelf
    simply because there was not a technology that had the speed, throughput, affordability
    and read length to make them practical,” said Dr. Jonathan M. Rothberg, Founder
    and President of Ion Torrent.  “Ion Torrent is the only sequencing technology
    that offers the ability to do all your ‘next-gen’ research applications in your
    own lab, while enabling a new generation of research applications that need same
    day results.”\r\n\r\nAward Winners\r\n\r\nDr. Carracedo, Director of the Galician
    Foundation of Genomic Medicine in Spain, was awarded the grant for his proposal
    to create a fast and affordable method for genetic screening of research samples
    from newborns.  \r\n\r\n“Up to now newborn genetic screening efforts have been
    limited by high cost, slow run times and limited throughput of existing sequencing
    technology,” said Carracedo.  “Our research will be focused on developing a newborn
    screening based on Ion amplicon sequencing for Cystic fibrosis, Wilson’s disease,
    Hurler-Scheie disease and other congenital metabolic diseases.”\r\n\r\nDr. Pallen,
    Professor of Microbial Genomics at the University of Birmingham in England, was
    awarded the grant for his proposal to identify, profile and type healthcare-associated
    bacterial pathogens in hospital settings– a huge and unmet problem that is now
    made solvable by the Ion PGM.\r\n\r\n“The excessive run times and high costs of
    previous sequencing methods have severely limited the real-time use of sequencing
    in medical microbiology settings,” said Pallen.  “The Ion PGM is already an order
    of magnitude cheaper and quicker with a performance rapidly improving in line
    with Moore’s law.  The ability to deliver cheap same-day results is essential
    to enable timely interventions in outbreak management.”\r\n\r\nHonorary Grant
    Winners Furthering Environmental and Ecological Research \r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Curtis,
    Professor of Environmental Engineering at Newcastle University, received an honorary
    grant for his proposal to routinely characterize the biology of waste treatment.
    \r\nDr. Howard Martin, Clinical Scientist, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS
    Foundation Trust and team, received a grant for their proposal to develop DNA
    sequence-based human leukocyte antigen (HLA) research.  \r\nDr. Ulf Landegren,
    Professor of Molecular Medicine for the Department of Genetics and Pathology at
    the Uppsala University, received a grant for his research proposal to run a multiplex
    proximity ligation assay (MultiPLAy) to measure protein biomarkers in the blood
    by antibody-mediated reverse translation of proteins to DNA sequences. \r\nThe
    Ion PGM Sequencer Grant Program was designed to foster the development of new
    research applications for DNA sequencing that leverage the instrument’s unprecedented
    speed, scalability and low cost.  These grants were also given in honor of the
    pioneering work of Drs. James Watson and Gordon Moore, which inspired the creation
    of the Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing technology.  The judges for the competition
    were Drs. Rothberg, Mathias Uhlen, George Church and Svante Pääbo. \r\n\r\nFor

<p>I am pleased to announce that I have won an <a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/products-ion-pgm/">Ion Torrent PGM</a> in Life Technologies' <a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/about-us-europe-ion-pgm-sequencer-grant-program/">European competition</a>. I am currently in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, Switzerland for the formal announcement of the award. A press release and further details should be appearing any moment now on the <a href="http://www.lifetechnologies.com/news-gallery/press-releases.html">press release section of Life Technologies’ web site</a> and on <a href="http://www.iontorrent.com/forum/">their forum</a>.</p>
<p>I am very excited about exploring the potential of Ion Torrent technology for unravelling the genomic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens in hospitals. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843733,20299126">We and others</a> have already established the potential of high-throughput sequencing for this application. I am fortunate that in that I already have funding from the British Medical Research Council to genome-sequence over a hundred isolates of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> using established approaches (454 and Illumina), plus the recent launch of a <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/MediaCentre/Pressreleases/DH_123638">NIHR Centre for Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology</a> in Birmingham brings additional opportunities for genomic epidemiology of infection in trauma patients. We are thus well placed to benchmark Ion Torrent against other technologies for this purpose and exploit this technology to do more work more quickly and more cheaply than we could with established approaches.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to taking receipt of an Ion Torrent instrument in the next month or two and will keep readers posted with our experience of the PGM. But for now, I had better get back to that glass of Champagne!</p>
