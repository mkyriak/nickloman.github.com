<p>We've had feedback about the xBASE whole-genome alignment function from some of you and there have been a number of recurring problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes the genome alignment does not seem to complete processing, and you can only get to the alignment view by clicking the supplied URL. Also a strange error message occur.</li>
<li>the drop-down menu of genomes does not show strain information. Additionally the drop-down menu is a bit hard to navigate.</li>
<li>The alignment, once processed, takes a long time to load.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working on an update to fix these 3 problems and hope to have it online as soon as possible!</p>
