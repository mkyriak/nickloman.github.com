<p>Working on the basis that undergraduate teaching materials are neither created nor destroyed, only transferred (Loman, 2009) I can heartily recommend this <a href="http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=305">two</a> <a href="http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=413">part</a> tutorial on DNA sequencing from <a href="http://www.genetic-interference.co.uk/">Luke Jostins</a>. I'm aware that my slides need updating to explain next-generation sequencing as well as Sanger sequencing to our 2nd year bioinformatics BSc students and so I may be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stealing</span> "transferring" some of these materials for my upcoming lectures. Click for <a href="http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=305">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=413">part 2</a>.</p>
