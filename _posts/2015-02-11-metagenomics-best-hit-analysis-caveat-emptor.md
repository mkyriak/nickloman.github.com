I gave a little quote to Ed Yong for <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/10/theres-no-plague-on-the-nyc-subway-no-platypuses-either/">his report</a> on the <a href="http://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/journals/research/cell-systems/do-not-delete/CELS1_FINAL.pdf">recent study</a> purporting to show <b>the bubonic plague</b> and <b>anthrax</b> on the New York subway.

I thought this would be a good time to put up a slide I use for whole-genome shotgun metagenomics teaching. Namely: what happens if you take an <em>E. coli</em> K-12 reference, shred it into 100 base reads, and then put it through a typical metagenomics pipeline relying on 'best hit' analysis:

I think the picture speaks for itself.
