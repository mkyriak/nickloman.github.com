<p>The University of Birmingham are organising a meeting in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.idrn.org/">Infectious Disease Research Network</a> on 10th-11th December. The focus of the meeting will be high-throughput sequencing as applied to infection. Confirmed speakers include <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/parkhill/">Julian Parkhill</a> from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, <a href="http://ifr48.timone.univ-mrs.fr/static/Raoult/index.html">Didier Raoult</a> from University of Marseille and my boss, Mark Pallen from University of Birmingham and this blog. Platform representatives from 454, Illumina and ABI will also be in attendance, talking about recent developments with their tech. I know that <a href="http://idrn.org/events/upcoming/sequencing.php">spaces are limited for this workshop</a> and it is likely to be sold-out, so please if you are interested, sign-up without delay!</p>
