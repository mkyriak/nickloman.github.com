<p>I've been putting off this blog entry hoping that I would be able to proudly point to a replenished, refreshed xBASE for you to peruse, a version packed with the latest database updates. No such luck I'm afraid, not through lack of trying: much has been going on behind the scenes including a great new code update from Roy Chaudhuri, the previous xBASE lead developer. The database schema has been tidied up and the whole system is more elegant and rational. We're using the <a href="http://www.biosql.org">BioSQL schema</a> now, which gives us lots of "quick wins" when it comes to adding new features to the site. Database updates should be easier to maintain than before. However there is still some work to be done to get the code ready to be unleashed on our patient user-base (i.e. you).</p>
<p>So please bear with us and as soon as a working alpha version of what we're calling xBASE version 2 is ready I will be updating the main page and linking from this blog.</p>
<p>For those of you who have contacted me with specific database update requests I will be writing to you directly with how you can get your hands on them early.</p>
<p>In the meantime, why not check out a site I found recently: <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/">Circos</a> - an amazing genome image generator. I might print some out for the office wall...</p>
