<p>We're happy to announce the <a href="http://watson.bham.ac.uk:8002/">xBASE 2.0 Preview site.<br />
</a></p>
<p>xBASE 2.0 represents a substantial backend re-write of the code, and an entirely new database based on the <a href="http://www.biosql.org">BioSQL</a> schema.</p>
<p>We would be very pleased to gather any community feedback at this stage. We are particularly interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>bugs that affect the functioning of the site</li>
<li>any missing datasets that are key to your research</li>
<li>any features from the old site that you miss</li>
</ul>
<p>Your feedback can be posted as a comment under this blog item, or if you prefer <a href="mailto:n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk">contact me via e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>This release will go on to replace the existing xBASE sites and microsites (colibase, campydb, pseudodb et al.) later this month.</p>
<p>A short list of the new functionality includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple alignment viewer: real-time <strong>whole genome </strong>alignments can be performed and then more alignments <strong>stacked </strong>on top</li>
<li>a completely new database schema using BioSQL, allowing easy updating of the genome datasets</li>
<li>all genome data from microsites (e.g. campydb, colibase) exist within a single database, allowing cross-taxon comparisons for the first time</li>
<li>an investment in new server hardware, resulting in speed increases</li>
<li>graphical circular chromosome viewer</li>
<li>more links to external databases</li>
<li>a commitment to monthly database updates, a la <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a>. We are calling the first database release number 20, to correspond to xBASE 2.0. Release 21 will be in September and regularly after that</li>
</ul>
<p>Much more is just around the corner!</p>
