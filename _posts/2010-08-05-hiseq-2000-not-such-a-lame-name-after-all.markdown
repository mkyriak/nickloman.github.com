    IBM PC Jr.\r\n\r\nI have gotten my first Illumina 2x100bp run, which did produce
    a pretty good assembly"

<p>Eyebrows were raised when we heard that the latest Solexa-technology sequencer would be called the Illumina HiSeq 2000. This kind of futuristic name was big in the 80s - remember Grecian 2000? - but in 2010 it sounded a bit on the lame side when we first heard it... but were Illumina just toying with us?</p>
<p>James Hadfield, my partner in crime on the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/">sequencing map project</a>, reports on Seqanswers <a href="http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6294">he's got his installed</a> and his first run yielded a theoretical 300Gb of data. And he speculates, given how easily it cranked that out - and given Illumina's great success in juicing throughput with the GA2 - perhaps the HiSeq 2000 is named thus because Illumina expect to get throughput up to 2000Gb (2 terabytes). It's a rather tasty idea. 33 human genomes at 20x coverage per run?</p>
<p>On the subject of the <a href="http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/hts/">sequencing map</a>, the sequencer categories have been updated to cope with the new machines: HiSeq, PacBio and SOLiD4 and I've taken the decision to dump the collection of array technologies. Not so much a comment on these technologies but a lack of interest from the community in keeping track of them.</p>
<p>The sharp-eyed will notice is that although Illumina announced they had shipped 100 HiSeq's "for revenue" <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/strong-demand-hiseq-contributes-50-percent-boost-sequencing-sales-illumina-q2?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+genomeweb+%28GenomeWeb+%C3%9Cberfeed%29">just a couple of days ago</a> the sequencing map is already tracking over 160 in the wild. How to explain? Well, BGI stake their claim to 128 HiSeq's on the map but there is a strong suspicion that these are not all installed yet. If you know what is going on, please contribute an update.</p>
<p><strong>Update 13/08/2010: </strong>This <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/08/11/BGI-exclusive.html">interview with Paul Tu</a> suggests there are currently 40 HiSeq's installed at the BGI. The map has been updated accordingly.</p>
