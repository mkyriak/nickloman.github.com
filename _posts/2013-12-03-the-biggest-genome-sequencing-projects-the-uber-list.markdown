  content: Pretty sure Ross Fitzgerald from Roslin should be on here, who is sequencing
    literally 100s of S aureus strains, from both human and animal infections.  I
    hear the data they get is of particularly good quality ;-)

  content: Lots of plague from China (http://www.pnas.org/content/110/2/577.long),
    and the "coming soon" lacks the invertebrates (I5K http://arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/i5K
    and GIGA http://giga.nova.edu/). The biggest thing you've missed out are all the
    human clinical genomes, as in the latest update from the SRA they were saying
    half their 2PB of data is now in the controlled access part (dbGAP/EGA), made
    up from ~40,000 individuals. There are lots of big cancer projects linked to ICGC
    (http://icgc.org/ - latest update supposedly 8500 genomes in their data portal),
    plus lots of autism genomes in the pipeline as well (http://autismgenome10k.org/).

    on the list I'm afraid. Will add the other projects. \r\n\r\nI guess I need to
    define some rules for inclusion which is: whole-genome sequence data generated
    fresh and published in a single study!"

    submitted an initial paper with ~400 individuals at around 10x coverage (for a
    2.7Gb Genome).\r\nhttp://www.1000bullgenomes.com/\r\n\r\nThere is the ERC funded

    one of the private animal breeding companies has sequenced 900 animals (550 WGS,
    400 RNAseq) with an initial paper utilizing some of the data having been accepted

---
<p>I am just writing a short presentation for a meeting in Hinxton. I wanted to demonstrate the profound effect that whole-genome sequencing is having on the study of biology, and the size and scope of recent studies.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be fun to catalogue the largest - in terms of samples - genome projects that have been published so far.</p>
<p>A few things are notable here. As expected, many of the biggest studies in terms of numbers are bacterial, enabled partly due to their smaller genome size.</p>
<p>Update: My attention has just been drawn to a study of 2,007 C. elegans genomes!</p>
<p>I found it interesting that all the bacterial studies listed herald from the UK, we are clearly blazing a trail in this field of study!</p>
<p>A PhD for sequencing a gene? A single genome? A hundred genomes? How about a thousand genomes? A million?</p>

<p>Did I miss a study? Please drop a comment below.</p>
<p>Rules for inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>whole-genome sequencing &gt;10X average per sample (no exome, target capture)</li>
<li>at least one library per sample (e.g. no pooled species, quasispecies)</li>
<li>not a meta-analysis, fresh data for the paper</li>
</ul>
