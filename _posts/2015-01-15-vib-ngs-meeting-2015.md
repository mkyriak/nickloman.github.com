Whilst following the #PAGXXIII tweets recently I really noticed
that livetweeting - whilst it offers intriguing nuggets of
information - are really hard to interpret without more context.

I suggested a potentially different way of doing livetweeting
which is to use a Google Doc or Etherpad to scribble notes, and
then to tweet links to it with salient quotes.

Anyway, I thought I would give it a try for the conference I am
attending and speaking at - the VIB NGS 2015 conference in 
Leuven, Belgium.

First off, it is trivially easy to set up an Etherpad and embed
it in this permalink. That way when the conference is over I
can simply cut-and-paste the text and turn it into a permanent
record, but for now I am free to edit it at will.
