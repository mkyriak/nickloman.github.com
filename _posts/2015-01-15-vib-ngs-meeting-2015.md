Whilst following the #PAGXXIII tweets I really noticed that livetweeting - whilst offering intriguing nuggets of information - are really hard to interpret without context. At best this is annoying, at worst it can result in countless clarifications and circular discussions.

I suggested a potentially different way of doing livetweeting which is to use a Google Doc or Etherpad to scribble notes, and then to tweet links to it with salient quotes.  

Anyway, I thought I would give it a try for the conference I am
attending and speaking at - the VIB NGS 2015 conference in 
Leuven, Belgium.

First off, it is trivially easy to set up an Etherpad (this one hosted by the folk at [mozilla.org](http://etherpad.mozilla.org) and embed it in this permalink. That way when the conference is over I will simply cut-and-paste the text and turn it into a permanent record, but for now my updates are live and subject to change. And if you are at the conference please feel free to add your own notes or clarifications, your text will come up in a different colour.
