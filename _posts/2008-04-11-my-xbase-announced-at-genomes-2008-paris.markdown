<p>Mark Pallen has announced a new service for the users of xBASE entitled 'My xBASE'. My xBASE is a service to aid researchers exploit the data produced by next-generation bacterial genome sequencers such as <a href="http://www.roche.com">454 (Roche)</a>and <a href="http://www.illumina.com">Solexa (Illumina)</a>.</p>
<p>Early applications of my xBASE will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>storage and processing of raw read files</li>
<li>mapping (alignment) against complete genome sequences</li>
<li>in silico techniques to aid finishing of incomplete sequences</li>
<li>comparative analysis of SNPs and regions of differences</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in beta testing our service, please register at <a href="http://my.xbase.ac.uk">my.xbase.ac.uk</a>. We will be in touch with futher instructions.</p>
