## January

"The past is a foreign country" -- well, that's how I feel about January 2015 looking back today.

## February

Was a good month.  Our paper on the Ebola real-time genomic surveillance work came out, and it looked like the Ebola epidemic was well and truly over.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s out! Real-time, portable genome sequencing for Ebola surveillance. <a href="https://t.co/fWkXHBpchZ">https://t.co/fWkXHBpchZ</a><br><br>Amazing work from <a href="https://twitter.com/Scalene">@Scalene</a> and many others</p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/694944105764364288">February 3, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Behind the paper blog post on the Ebola surveillance.

There was also fun to be had at AGBT.

## March

Just as we thought we had left Ebola behind, there was a flare-up!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samples from the new Ebola cases in East Guinea received yesterday; extracted &amp; amplified overnight, sequenced today. Results inbound to WHO</p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/711615093604229121">March 20, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHO update on Ebola flareup -we helped resolve source of cases with in-country sequencing: <a href="https://t.co/K7kCGkHvwV">https://t.co/K7kCGkHvwV</a> <a href="https://t.co/P3yf2ZsFXj">pic.twitter.com/P3yf2ZsFXj</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/712779397611266049">March 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

These cases were traced to a survivor who had been infected some 500 days previously.
A remarkable demonstration of the power of genomics, working in synergy with
the epidemiologists on the ground.

Around the same time, we learnt we had been funded by MRC/Wellcome Trust/Newton
to receive funds as part of the emergency response to Zika. Remarkably, the outcome was known just a few weeks after submitting the application, and we had the money just days after that!

## April

We wasted no time getting started. Josh flew to Sao Paulo to Ester Sabino's laboratory to start testing out sequencing protocols for Zika.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That <a href="https://twitter.com/Scalene">@scalene</a> is a class act. 15 hour flight and 3 hours in customs last night and this evening he&#39;s sending over some Zika sequences.</p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/723635858830692352">April 22, 2016</a></blockquote>


## May

Oxford Nanopore released the R9 pore and it was something of a relief to see it was working well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMG, nanopore R9 just got a bit more real - first 2D read I BLASTed <a href="https://t.co/p0493mL7s6">pic.twitter.com/p0493mL7s6</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/732702273940426753">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nanopore R9 does seem to give a nice shift in quality compared with R7.3, and with the added bonus of 250bp/s speed <a href="https://t.co/JKWD3NBCVd">pic.twitter.com/JKWD3NBCVd</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/729222116193734657">May 8, 2016</a></blockquote>

We launched the <a href="http://zibraproject.org">ZiBRA project</a>, a <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0356-2">road trip</a> around North-East Brazil to investigate the genomic epidemiology of Zika cases in this region, the most heavily hit by cases of microcephaly in newborns..

## June

We hit the road for the ZiBRA project and started generating Zika genomes!

<img src="http://www.zibraproject.org/images/ricardo/thumbs/Zibra%20Natal_029.jpg" />

We made lots of new lifelong friends in Brazil, and we didn't die even though our bus caught on fire at one point, although we hit some technical obstacles with sequencing very very low abundance samples.

The year seemed to be going pretty well. Until the Brexit vote ...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Going to bed feeling quite relaxed that the outcome will be fairly strong remain vote tomorrow.

## July

We launched the CLIMB project!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our preprint describing <a href="https://twitter.com/MRCClimb">@MRCClimb</a>, an amazing virtual compute infrastructure for microbial bioinformatics is now up! <a href="https://t.co/p5fH5TOu8u">https://t.co/p5fH5TOu8u</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/755460739486318592">July 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

So far over 150 research groups in the UK have signed up for our virtual machine infrastructure which runs across three sites (Birmingham, Warwick and Cardiff) with Swansea to launch in 2017.  Particular props to Radoslaw Poplawski, Tom Connor, Andy Smith, Marius Bakke and Matt Bull on the technical side who helped get this launched - just in time!

## August

We sweated over the Zika sequencing protocol and eventually by the end of summer <a href="http://www.zibraproject.org/blog/a-new-method-for-whole-zika-virus-sequencing/">Josh Quick</a> nailed something that worked well on samples with very low viral copy numbers. 

In August we just about had time to fit in a week in Cornwall to teach <a href="http://porecamp.github.io">Porecamp</a> with Konrad and his crew.

Pablo, Emily, Jennie and Andy really got <a href="http://microbesng.uk">MicrobesNG</a> motoring (over 7500 genomes sequenced with a median wait time of 6 weeks!), with insert sizes bolstered with a nice new Nextera XT protocol.

## Sep

The manuscript describing March's Ebola flare-up was published.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our study on a remarkable case from April 16 Ebola flareup; transmission from survivor *500* days post-infection  <a href="https://t.co/TNk77RFoqS">https://t.co/TNk77RFoqS</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/771263715467337729">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>

Zika genomes were coming out thick and fast thanks to the new protocol, our Brazilian collaborators, Sarah Hill and Alli Black. Josh's third trip in 2017. A <a href="http://nextstrain.org/zika/">picture of Zika diversity</a> was now starting to be built (beautifully visualised by Trevor and Richard's wonderful Nextstrain site - <a href="http://event.capconcorp.com/wp/osp/">vote for them</a> to win the Open Science prize!).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well done <a href="https://twitter.com/Scalene">@scalene</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alliblk">@alliblk</a> and Sarah Hill - smashing out the Zika genomes in Salvador, Brazil with <a href="https://twitter.com/zibraproject">@zibraproject</a> since Friday</p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/774930129025892353">September 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

A stunning new preprint from Andrew Rambaut, Gytis Dudas and the whole cast of Ebola sequencing collaborators was posted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An unbelievably comprehensive phylogeographic study of 1600 Ebola genomes from <a href="https://twitter.com/arambaut">@arambaut</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/evogytis">@EvoGytis</a> and others. <a href="https://t.co/3ywVp6XgKd">https://t.co/3ywVp6XgKd</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/771759136010797056">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

We only managed one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_ZY9_OyRhE">Balti and Bioinformatics</a> in 2016 but it was a good one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ooh, it&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BaltiandBioinformatics?src=hash">#BaltiandBioinformatics</a> today, featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/koadman">@koadman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lexnederbragt">@lexnederbragt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/torstenseemann">@torstenseemann</a> !

Christiane and the crew put on a good show at  <a href="http://genomescience.org.uk">Genome Science</a>. 

## Oct

I met Bill Gates and Nathan Myrvhold and gave a presentation at a "learning session" for Bill about using NGS to fight infection: it was incredible. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Life achievement unlocked. <a href="https://t.co/6Y9v6sdLVv">pic.twitter.com/6Y9v6sdLVv</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/784092128838160384">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>

All the depressing news on Twitter got too much for me, and I took a break for 3 weeks. After 24 hours of extreme withdrawal symptoms, it was actually quite nice to do something else with my time, like imagining what people were saying on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Relentless Brexit and Trump news is turning Twitter into an ordeal rather than a pleasure these days.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

They did, though.

(By the way Zam you were wrong).

## Nov

Donald Trump - PEOTUS.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow what a terrible dream.</p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/796272052693041152">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote>

Not a dream though.

## Dec

A relaxed end to the year -- we did a bit of Beach sequencing with Andrew Rambaut and Tom Little.

And we managed to release data from a 30x human genome on MinION working collaboratively on the sequencing with Nottingham, UCSC, UBC and Norwich, a mere 39 flowcells for that (assembly N50 - 3Mb!):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Initial FASTQ release of human NA12878 <a href="https://twitter.com/nanopore">@nanopore</a> whole-genome dataset available here (29 flowcells!) <a href="https://t.co/ZkirbOfztf">https://t.co/ZkirbOfztf</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nanoporeconf?src=hash">#nanoporeconf</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/804471249053372417">December 1, 2016</a></blockquote>

Nanopore got named one of Science's 10 breakthroughs of the year and we got a little name check.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencemagazine">@sciencemagazine</a> for referencing our work in their feature on <a href="https://twitter.com/nanopore">@nanopore</a> as Top 10 Breakthroughs of the Year! <a href="https://t.co/3s7jeMZ2E0">https://t.co/3s7jeMZ2E0</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/812013105551208448">December 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

Finally in December, we heard the great news that the Ebola ca suffit! trial reported 100% efficacy for the Ebola vaccine. Well done Stephan, Miles, Sophie and all the others who worked on this.

## A few changes in 2017

The MicrobesNG team sees a chang in 2017 - we are sad to say goodbye to Andy Smith - our database programmer on the MicrobesNG project. He’s done an amazing job building the MicrobesNG website, our LIMS, the CLIMB Bryn site, and even had time to help out with the Zibra Project database and the Primal Scheme site. We cannot be too annoyed that he only spent a year with us -- he's had the once in a lifetime opportunity to become a trainee pilot with Aer Lingus, a lifetime dream for Andy.

There have been some changes in Birmingham too -- it's been really nice to have Alan McNally join the IMI as a new Senior Lecturer.  And we are really excited that Willem van Schaik is joining the IMI later in April, Brexit be damned!

And so we enter 2017 with some trepidation, but also hope that the awesome wins out.

Happy New Year to all friends and collaborators from the Loman Lab!
