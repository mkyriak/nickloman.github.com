<p>Oxford Nanopore have been pretty close-lipped on specs for their nanopore-based sequencing technology, but the always quotable Clive Brown - "<a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=94068&terms=nanopore+OR+brown+OR+honest">the most honest man in sequencing</a>" let out a <a href="http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=40470&postcount=15">little teaser</a> on Seqanswers.com where we had been discussing <a href="http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10983">the future of 454</a>.</p>
<p>Clive asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What if: Your reads were over 100kb, very accurate and you had a mountain of them ?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds pretty bloody good to us Clive! Feel free to expand on this in the comments section :)</p>
