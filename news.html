	<p><b>June, 2014</b>. We got up and running with the Oxford Nanopore MinION and were the first group to <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/A_P_aeruginosa_serotype_defining_single_read_from_our_first_Oxford_Nanopore_run/1052996">publish a read</a> from this instrument, see press coverage at <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=139007&terms=figshare">Bio-IT World</a> and <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/first-oxford-nanopore-users-comment-experience-minion-start-posting-data">GenomeWeb</a>. Lots of exciting samples to try out now!</a></p>

	<p><b>May, 2014</b>. We received our Oxford Nanopore <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/statuses/454555293759057920">MinIONs</a>!. New <a href="http://genomea.asm.org/content/2/3/e00355-14.full.pdf">Genome Announcement of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</a>. The <a href="http://www.climb.ac.uk">MRC CLIMB website</a> for cloud computing in microbial genomics is now live. We received notification that our <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2013/2013-bioinformatics-biological-resources-fund.aspx">grant proposal to the BBSRC for our MicrobesNG service</a> was funded. I gave an interview to Keith Bradnam's series on <a href="http://www.acgt.me/blog/2014/5/18/101-questions-with-a-bioinformatician-8-nick-loman">interviews with bioinformaticians</a>.</p>
		
	<p><b>February, 2014</b>. I was proud to be part of the awesome Evomics 2014 course held in Cesky Krumlov. There are some <a href="http://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-genomics/2014-workshop-on-genomics-cesky-krumlov/">great presentations and tutorials available</a> on their site.</p>

	<p>We have been accepted onto the <a href="https://www.nanoporetech.com/technology/the-minion-device-a-miniaturised-sensing-system/minion-access-programme">first wave</a> of the Oxford Nanopore MinION access programme!</p>

	<p>The Medical Research Council announced that <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC009720">a consortium for medical microbial bioinformatics</a> consisting of the Universities of Warwick, Birmingham, Swansea and Cardiff will be funded! This will provide an investment of nearly >Â£4m in server hardware and storage in Birmingham, as well as a five-year fellowship for me.</a>

	<p><b>January, 2013</b>. I had a lot of fun instructing and learning at C. Titus Brown's "Assembly Masterclass". If you are interested in assembly, there are lots of useful new tutorials and guides posted on the <a href="http://davis-assembly-masterclass-2013.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">course website</a>.</p>
		<p>A collaboration with Chris Quince (Glasgow) and Anders Andersson (SciLifeLab, Sweden) on a novel algorithm for genome binning we call CONCOCT has reached maturity, and a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4038">preprint is now available in the arXiv.</a></p>
		<p>A new paper in PLoS ONE from a collaboration with Waltham Petcare (part of Mars) was published on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349448">oral microbiota of dogs.</a></p>

		<p><b>November, 2013</b>. <a href="http://biomickwatson.wordpress.com/">Mick Watson</a> and I have penned a commentary in Nature Biotechnology which may be of interest entitled: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n11/full/nbt.2740.html">So you want to be a computational biologist?</a>. I've also updated this page to add some details of upcoming <a href="#training">training courses</a>.
